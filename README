Preprocessing

1) Build with clang
2) Normal build

In some case, we get a raw list of results

cqa-compare-ref-rebuild -s /tmp/log-clang-14-06-16/ -o /tmp/log-clang-14-06-16-results -i clang

3) Generation the list of packages. It will find the error.

From the log directory, run:
cqa-scanlogs > ../scanlog-3.1-2012-06-23

This program can be found here:
http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/collab-qa/collab-qa-tools/
and Debian packages should be created

Or you can install with collab-qa-tools

4) Import the file into the database
Edit insert.php
Update the path, the version and the date

Run, it should insert in the db

With reimport-all.sh, all previous scanlog-* are going to be reimported.
This should be done when new categories are created.

5) Update status.php to add the support of the new version
update config.inc.php for the number of packages

6) Check:
http://localhost/status.php?version=X.Y&key=NO_CAT

Check for new common error message and add then listErrors.php 

In status.php, don't hesitate to use the SQL search SOUNDEX(reverse(detected_error))
to have a better sort
