Preprocessing

1) Build with clang
2) Normal build

In some case, we get a raw list of results

The following command with give the list of packages failing with clang but OK under unstable.
grep DIFFEXP res.compared > res.fail.only.clang
LIST=$(less res.fail.only.clang|awk '{print $1}')
for f in $LIST; do grep "^$f " clang.txt; done >  scanlog-3.3-2013-07-14

3) Generation the list of packages. It will find the error.

From the log directory, run:
cqa-scanlogs > ../scanlog-3.1-2012-06-23

This program can be found here:
http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/collab-qa/collab-qa-tools/
and Debian packages should be created

4) Import the file into the database
Edit insert.php
Update the path, the version and the date

Run, it should insert in the db

Update status.php to add the support of the new version
update config.inc.php for the number of packages

5) Check:
http://localhost/status.php?version=X.Y&key=NO_CAT

Check for new common error message and add then listErrors.php 

In status.php, don't hesitate to use the SQL search SOUNDEX(reverse(detected_error))
to have a better sort
