 Description: STONITH Block Device daemon
  SBD provides a node fencing mechanism (Shoot the other node in the
  head, STONITH) for Pacemaker-based clusters through the exchange of
  messages via shared block storage such as for example a SAN, iSCSI,
  FCoE. It can be used as a STONITH mechanism in all configurations
  that have reliable shared storage.
