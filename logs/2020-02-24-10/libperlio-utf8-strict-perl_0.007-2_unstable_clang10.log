 Description: fast and correct UTF-8 Perl IO module
  PerlIO::utf8_strict provides a fast and correct UTF-8 PerlIO layer.
  Unlike perl's default :utf8 layer it checks the input for correctness
  and will croak if it finds an ill-formed UTF-8 octet sequence or
  noncharacter code points not meant for interchange.
