 Description: reachability analyzer for Algebraic System Nets
  Maria is a powerful tool designed to aid engineers in modelling and
  solving concurrency related problems in parallel and distributed
  computing systems.
  .
  Maria finds deadlocks and violations against safety or liveness
  requirements by exploring all states that can be reached from the
  initial state of a system.  The tool manages tens or hundreds of
  millions of reachable states and enabled actions.
  .
  The expressive power of Maria's formalism is close to high-level
  programming languages, thanks to its rich data type system and
  powerful algebraic operations.
