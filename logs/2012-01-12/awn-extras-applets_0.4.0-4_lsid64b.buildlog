There are some common causes of this problem: 1) your configuration path file /etc/gconf/2/path doesn't contain any databases or wasn't found 2) somehow we mistakenly created two gconfd processes 3) your operating system is misconfigured so NFS file locking doesn't work in your home directory or 4) your NFS client machine crashed and didn't properly notify the server on reboot that file locks should be dropped. If you have two gconfd processes (or had two at the time the second was launched), logging out, killing all copies of gconfd, and logging back in may help. If you have stale locks, remove ~/.gconf*/*lock. Perhaps the problem is that you attempted to use GConf from two machines at once, and ORBit still has its default configuration that prevents remote CORBA connections - put "ORBIIOPIPv4=1" in /etc/orbitrc. As always, check the user.* syslog for details on problems gconfd encountered.

There are some common causes of this problem: 1) your configuration path file /etc/gconf/2/path doesn't contain any databases or wasn't found 2) somehow we mistakenly created two gconfd processes 3) your operating system is misconfigured so NFS file locking doesn't work in your home directory or 4) your NFS client machine crashed and didn't properly notify the server on reboot that file locks should be dropped.

WARNING: failed to install schema `/schemas/apps/awn-applet-mail/backend', locale `C': Unable to store a value at key '/schemas/apps/awn-applet-mail/backend', as the configuration server has no writable databases. There are some common causes of this problem: 1) your configuration path file /etc/gconf/2/path doesn't contain any databases or wasn't found 2) somehow we mistakenly created two gconfd processes 3) your operating system is misconfigured so NFS file locking doesn't work in your home directory or 4) your NFS client machine crashed and didn't properly notify the server on reboot that file locks should be dropped. If you have two gconfd processes (or had two at the time the second was launched), logging out, killing all copies of gconfd, and logging back in may help. If you have stale locks, remove ~/.gconf*/*lock.

There are some common causes of this problem: 1) your configuration path file /etc/gconf/2/path doesn't contain any databases or wasn't found 2) somehow we mistakenly created two gconfd processes 3) your operating system is misconfigured so NFS file locking doesn't work in your home directory or 4) your NFS client machine crashed and didn't properly notify the server on reboot that file locks should be dropped. If you have two gconfd processes (or had two at the time the second was launched), logging out, killing all copies of gconfd, and logging back in may help. If you have stale locks, remove ~/.gconf*/*lock.

 Description: A collection of applets for Awn, written in python
  Awn-extras-applets is a collection of applets for avant-window-navigator. It
  provides some extensions to the bar and some new features (like
  applets in the gnome-panel).
  .
  This package provides the core Python applets:
   * animal-farm : Various animals tell your fortune.
   * bandwidth-monitor: Displays information from network.
   * battery-applet: This applet displays your computers current power status.
   * cairo-clock: Displays an analog clock.
   * comics: View your favourite comics on your desktop.
   * cpufreq: Monitors and controls the CPU frequency.
   * dialect: Manages keyboard layouts.
   * feeds: A Python feed launcher.
   * file-browser-launcher: Launches the user's file manager or opens bookmarks.
   * hardware sensors: Displays information from sensors.
   * mail: The Mail Applet lets you check your mail from AWN.
   * media-control: This applet displays album art in a awn dialog while
     allowing you to control your favorite media players.
   * media-player: Plays any media files you drop on it.
   * mount-applet: Displays mounts from /etc/fstab and allows one to
     mount/unmount them.
   * quit-applet: A simple gnome-quit launcher.
   * stack: Provides a convenient location to place commonly used files.
   * thinkhdaps: Displays the status of HDAPS.
   * todo: Manage a simple To-Do list.
   * volume-control: A fancy volume changing applet that works much like the
     gnome-panel version.
   * weather: This applet downloads and displays the current weather conditions
     and weather forecast from weather.com.

     several external calendar applications to display appointments.
   * media-icon-applet: This applet allows you to add media icons like play,
     pause, and next/back to your awn bar, and control a list of media players.
   * pandora: Plays Pandora internet radio.
   * slickswitcher: A visual workspace switcher.
   * tomboy-applet: Control Tomboy with D-Bus.
   * YAMA: Yet another menu applet
