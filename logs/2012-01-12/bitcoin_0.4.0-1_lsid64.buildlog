   * New upstream release.
   * Stop repackaging source tarballs: No DFSG-violating stripping left.
   * Update copyright file:
     + Add Github URL to Source.
   * Drop dpkg-source local-options hint: Declared options are default
     since dpkg-source 1.16.1.
     + Add irc URL to Upstream-Contact.
     + Add comment on Bitcoin Developers to catch-all Files section.
     + Add Files sections for newly readded src/cryptopp/* (new custom
       BSD-like license), and newly added doc/build-osx.txt and
       src/makefile.osx (Expat).
   * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 7.
   * Suppress binary icns and gpg files.
   * Enable regression tests:
     + Build-depend on libboost-test-dev.
     + Extend patch 1003 to also dynamically link test binary.
     + Build and invoke test binary unless tests are disabled.
   * Tighten build-dependency on cdbs: Recent version needed to support
     debhelper 7.
   * Relax build-depend unversioned on debhelper: needed version
     satisfied even in oldstable.
   * Stop suppress optional build-dependencies: Satisfied in stable.
     Build-depend on devscripts (enabling copyright-check).

 Description: peer-to-peer network based anonymous digital currency - daemon
  Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
  is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
  trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
  transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
  check for double-spending.
  .
  By default connects to an IRC network to discover other peers.
  .
  Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  This
  requires 150+ MB of space, slowly growing.
  .
  This package provides bitcoind, a combined daemon and CLI tool to
  interact with the daemon.
