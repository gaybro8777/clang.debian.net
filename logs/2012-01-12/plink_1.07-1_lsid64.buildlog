 Description: whole-genome association analysis toolset
  plink expects as input the data from SNP (single
  nucleotide polymorphism) chips of many individuals
  and their phenotypical description of a disease.
  It finds associations of single or pairs of DNA
  variations with a phenotype and can retrieve
  SNP annotation from an online source.
  .
  SNPs can evaluated individually or as pairs for their
  association with the disease phenotypes. The joint
  investigation of copy number variations is supported.
  A variety of statistical tests have been implemented.
  .
  Please note: The executable was renamed to p-link
  because of a name clash.  Please read more about this
  in /usr/share/doc/README.Debian.
