 Description: Ruby interface to Yajl, a JSON stream-based parser library
  Supported features include,
  .
  JSON parsing and encoding directly to and from an IO stream
  (file, socket, etc) or String. Compressed stream parsing and
  encoding supported for Bzip2, Gzip and Deflate.
  .
  Parse and encode *multiple* JSON objects to and from streams or strings
  continuously.
  .
  JSON gem compatibility API - allows yajl-ruby to be used as a drop-in
  replacement for the JSON gem
  .
  Basic HTTP client (only GET requests supported for now) which parses JSON
  directly off the response body *as it's being received*
