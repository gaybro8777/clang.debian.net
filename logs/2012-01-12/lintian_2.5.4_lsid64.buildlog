   * checks/*:
     + [JW] Replace common_data.pm with Lintian::Check.
     + [NT] Remove some unused "use lib <expr>" from various checks.
     + [NT] Use Lintian::Collect::Group to find direct dependencies.
   * checks/binaries:
     + [JW] Allow binaries to use "/usr/lib/$srcpkg/" in RPATHs.
       (Closes: #642092)
     + [JW] Fixed a false-positive when using the multiarch dir in
       RPATH.  (Closes: #646817)
   * checks/changes-file{,.desc}:
     + [NT] Added the "precise" to the list of Ubuntu distributions.
       Thanks to Loïc Minier for the patch.
     + [NT] Accept release codename in the changes file.  Thanks to
       Julien Cristau for the report.  (Closes: #637540)
   * checks/circular-deps{,.desc}:
     + [NT] Renamed to group-checks{,.desc}.
   * checks/group-checks{,.desc}:
     + [NT] Added check for depending on lower priority packages built
       from the same source.  Only strong dependencies are considered.
       Thanks to Neil Williams for the report.  (Closes: #387166)
   * checks/common_data.pm:
     + [JW] Merged into Lintian::Check.
   * checks/cruft{,.desc}:
     + [NT] Escape path when using them in regexes.  (Closes: #642902)
     + [NT] Extended the description of the tag for non-native packages
       with native versions.  Thanks to Jari Aalto for the report.
       (Closes: #580048)
   * checks/copyright.desc:
     + [RG,NT] Clarified that the PHP 2.x license is only for the PHP
       interpreter and PEAR modules cannot use it.  Thanks to
       Thomas Goirand for the report.  (Closes: #616436)
   * checks/deb-format{,.desc}:
     + [NT] Added check for using .xz compression in deb files without
       versioned Pre-Depends on dpkg.  The severity is pedantic for
       Debian and serious for Ubuntu.  Thanks to Aaron M. Ucko for the
       rapport.  (Closes: #648350)
   * checks/dehelper{,.desc}:
     + [JW,NT] Check for versioned dependencies for some dh_commands.
       (Closes: #641035)
     + [JW] Detect missing dependencies for using dh sequences.
       (Closes: #613327)
     + [JW] Parse continuation lines in d/rules.
     + [JW] Only emit brace-expansion-in-debhelper-config-file at most
       once per file.  (Closes: #644344)
     + [JW] Replaced "=" with " => " in the tag extra for missing-
       build-dependency-for-dh_-command to improve readability.  This
       breaks overrides, but according to lintian.d.o there are none
       of these.  (Closes: #644339)
     + [JW] Added check for missing python helpers when using python
       substvars in d/control.  (Closes: #582511)
   * checks/fields{,.desc}:
     + [NT] Fixed source-field-does-not-match-pkg-name.
     + [NT] Newlines from URIs in Vcs-* fields are stripped before they
       are checked.  These will fields will also cause a "multiline-
       field" tag if they contain newlines.
     + [JW,NT] Clarified that build-depends-on-metapackage is not only
       triggered by X11 metapackages.  (Closes: #642125)
     + [NT] Ensure transitional packages are in section oldlibs and
       priority extra.  Thanks to Josh Triplett for the report.
       (Closes: #645438)
     + [NT] Check for bouncing and looping email addresses.  Thanks to
       Ansgar Burchardt and Arno Töll for the bug report and patch.
       (Closes: #636599)
   * checks/files{,.desc}:
     + [JW] Suggest the usage of "-delete" rather than "| xargs rm -f".
       (Closes: #641983)
     + [JW] Improve "linked against libvga.so" test.  This avoid
       setuid-binary false-positives.  (Closes: #642038)
     + [NT] Skip package-contains-no-arch-dependent-files for
       transitional packages.  Thanks to Andreas Beckmann for the patch.
       (Closes: #642339)
     + [NT] Applied patch from Andrew Starr-Bochicchio to update the
       description of font-in-non-font-package to better reflect current
       font policy.  (Closes: #646838)
     + [JW,NT] Check that gzip files are compressed with -n in
       "Multi-Arch: same" packages.  (Closes: #649329)
       packages.
     + [NT] Corrected perl4 check, thanks to Dominic Hargreaves for the
       report and the patch.
   * checks/init.d{,.desc}:
     + [NT] Applied patch from Peter Eisentraut to detect init.d scripts
       without support for the optional "status" option.
       (Closes: #647250)

       (Closes: #649133)
     + [NT] Added tag for missing LSB Description keyword.  Thanks to
       Michael Biebl and Petter Reinholdtsen for the bug report.
       (Closes: #604620)
   * checks/rules{,.desc}:
     + [JW] Fixed false negative "missing-build-dependency" when using
       "dh --with=X" rather than "dh --with X".  (Closes: #643714)
     + [NT] Do not emit missing-build-dependency for missing dh sequences,
       since the new tag will handle those.
     + [JW] Parse continuation lines in d/rules.  (Closes: #644021)
     + [JW] Check for versioned dependency on dpkg-dev when using the new
       dpkg makefiles.  (Closes: #646495)
     + [NT] Added tracker tag for the build-arch target goal.
       (Closes: #647227)
     + [JW] Fixed duplicate tags about missing dependency for
       dh_pycentral/dh_pysupport.  (Closes: #633507)
   * checks/scripts:
     + [RA] Exclude files ending in *.erb from several shell script
       checks.  ERB is a Ruby templating language, so these will probably
       have mixed shell and Ruby code and may not be executable.  Thanks,
       Laurent Arnoud.
     + [NT] Corrected perl4 check, thanks to Dominic Hargreaves for the
       report and the patch.  (Closes: #648532)
   * checks/source-copyright:
     + [JW] Added some more DEP-5 URLs.  (Closes: #642027)
     + [JW] Improved the wording of the extra information for the tag
       syntax-error-in-dep5-copyright.  (Closes: #644556)
   * checks/symlinks:
     + [NT] Ignore broken links that appears to point to fonts.
 .
   * collection/index:
     + [NT] Fixed an "uninitialized variable" warning if no tarballs were
       present or the tarball is empty.  (Closes: #645660, LP: #886487)
     + [NT] Fixed deprecation warning when using perl 5.14.
   * collcetion/debfiles:
     + [NT] Bail if the debian dir is a symlink.
 .
   * data/changelog-file/debian-dists:
     + [NT] New file.
   * data/changelog-file/ubuntu-dists:
     + [NT] Added the "precise".  Thanks to Loïc Minier for the
       patch.  (Closes: #644488)
   * data/debhelper/{dh_commands,maint_commands,miscDepends_commands}:
     + [NT] Refreshed.
   * data/debhelper/alt-dh_commands:
     + [NT] Renamed to dh_commands-manual.
   * data/debhelper/dh_commands-manual:
     + [NT] Support arbitrary dependency relations.  This new change
       also fixes a "duplicate" in the dependency output.
       (Closes: #643716)
   * data/fields/essential:
     + [NT] Add libc-bin to the list of known essential packages.
   * data/fields/obsolete-packages:
     + [NT] Added dpatch per request of the maintainer.  Thanks to
       Gergely Nagy for the report.  (Closes: #646420)
   * data/fields/virtual-packages:
     + [NT] Refreshed against sid.  Thanks to Gregor Herrmann for the
       report.  (Closes: #646604)
   * data/rules/deprecated-makefiles:
     + [JW] Added dbs makefiles, since dbs maintainer deprecated the
       package in 0.47.  (Closes: #646126)
   * data/shared-libs/ldconfig-dirs:
     + [NT] Add multi-arch dirs for hurd-i386.  Thanks to Julien
       Cristau for noticing that they were missing.
   * data/spelling/corrections:
     + [NT] Added a correction for "propagate" and "separate", thanks
       to Guillem Jover for the suggestions.
       (Closes: #644793, #646529)
     + [JW] Added a number of corrections.  (Closes: #645393)
 .
   * debian/control:
     + [CW] Mark lintian Multi-Arch: foreign (there does exist one
       Architecture: any package that Build-Depends: lintian, so this helps
       multiarch cross-building slightly).
   * debian/lintian.install:
     + [NT] Removed unpack which was removed.
 .
   * frontend/lintian:
     + [NT] Collections explicitly requested (by -U) are no longer
       auto-removed.  Previously the only way to prevent auto-removal
       was to use --keep-lab.
     + [NT] Removed all archive-wide testing code.  This has been moved
       into reporting/harness.  This deprecates a lot options and config
       variables (--arch, --archivedir, --area, --dist, --section and
       LINTIAN_{ARCH,ARCHIVEDIR,AREA,DIST}).
     + [NT] Support new lab query format, replacing the old "package
       name"-based search.
 .
   * lib/Lab{,/Package}.pm:
     + [NT] Removed, replaced by Lintian::Package{,::Entry}.
   * lib/Lintian/Check.pm:
     + [JW] Merged with common_data.pm.
   * lib/Lintian/Collect/Group.pm:
     + [NT] New file - Collect like API for group data.
   * lib/Lintian/Collect/Source.pm:
     + [JW] Fixed call to binary_field in binary_relation.
       (Closes: #641609)
   * lib/Lintian/Data.pm:
     + [NT] Fixed a file descriptor leak.
   * lib/Lintian/Lab{,/Entry,/Manifest,/ManifestDiff}.pm:
     + [NT] New files.  Replaces the Read_pkglists, Lab and
       Lab::Package modules.
   * lib/Lintian/Lab.pm:
     + [JW,NT] Correctly handle $TMPDIR not being an absolute path.
       (Closes: #642113)
     + [NT] New lab layout style resembling the "pool" dirs of the
       Debian mirrors.  This allows more than 32 000 packages of a
       given type in the laboratory.  It also allows multiple
       versions/architectures of the same package in static labs.
       A feature previously only enabled in temporary labs.  The new
       layout is incompatible with the old format.  (Closes: #641468)
   * lib/Lintian/Output.pm:
     + [NT] Minor refactoring to simplify creation of the FullEWI
       module.
   * lib/Lintian/Output/FullEWI.pm:
     + [NT] New experimental output.  More machine-friendly version
       of the normal Lintian output format.
   * lib/Lintian/Output/XML.pm:
     + [NT] Use self-closing tags (if possible) and do not write
       attributes with an empty value.
   * lib/Lintian/Processable.pm:
     + [NT] Reduced to an abstract class.  The "old" implementation
       has been put into Lintian::Processable::Package.
   * lib/Lintian/Processable/Package.pm:
     + [NT] New file.
     + [NT] Changed the "name" of changes files.  It is now equal to
       the name of the source package.  Previously it was the filename
       (without extension and without the dir part).
   * lib/Read_pkglists.pm:
     + [NT] Removed - replaced by Lintian::Lab::Manifest.
   * lib/Util.pm:
     + [NT] Stricten the parser to not accept a field name with a ":".
       This could cause the parser to eat the first part of the value,
       if it contained a colon and there was no space before the value.
       Thanks to Pino Toscano for reporting the issue.
     + [JW] Explicitly check that files are not encoded using ISO-2022,
       when they should be encoded with UTF-8.  (Closes: #643009)
     + [JW] Use "paragraph" and "field" rather than "section" and "tag"
       when referring to a Debian control file.
 .
   * man/lintian.pod.in:
     + [NT] Fixed a typo, thanks to Evgeni Golov for spotting it,
 .
   * private/generate-lintian-pod:
     + [NT] Document which collections are auto-removed by default in
       static labs.
 .
   * profiles/ubuntu/main.profile:
     + [NT] Disable no-upstream-changelog and lzma-deb-archive for
       Ubuntu.  Thanks to Evan Broder for the report and patch.
       (Closes: #648117)
 .
   * reporting/*:
     + [NT] Recognise and display pedantic tags.
     + [JW] Only emit "plus X overrides" if there any overrides.
   * reporting/{harness,html_reports}:
     + [NT] Do not accept LINTIAN_UNPACK_LEVEL nor LINTIAN_SECTION
       anymore.  The lintian frontend lost support for these in
       2.5.0~rc3.
   * reporting/harness:
     + [NT] Refactored to handle the archive-wide checking directly.
     + [NT] Use the new FullEWI output format for the archive-wide
       logs.
   * reporting/html_reports:
     + [NT] Ensure source tags appear before binary tags.
       (Closes: #580945)
     + [NT] Supports the FullEWI output format.
 .
   * t/*:
     + [NT] Skip some tests broken by a recent dpkg upload.
       (Closes: #643205)
 .
   * unpack/*:
     + [NT] Removed, no longer used.

 Description: Debian package checker
  Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
  violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
  policy as well as some checks for common errors.
  .
  It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores
  information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this
  information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
  expensive data-collection operations. This makes it possible to check the
  complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
  .
  This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
  packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
  should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
  archive.
  .
  This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 3.9.2.
