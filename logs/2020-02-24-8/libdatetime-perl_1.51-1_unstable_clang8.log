 Description: module for manipulating dates, times and timestamps
  DateTime is a Perl module which aims to provide a complete, correct, and easy
  to use date/time object implementation. It provides an easy way to manipulate
  dates and times, including date calculations (even addition and subtraction)
  and provides convenient methods for extracting or modifying portions of any
  date or time.
  .
  This module supports the Olson time zone database, meaning that historical
  time zone information, and more importantly, daylight saving time rules, can
  be handled transparently, simply by setting the correct time zone. This is
  done by using the DateTime::TimeZone module.
