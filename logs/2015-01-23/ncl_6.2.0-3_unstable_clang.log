	You have completed the configuration process. Once you exit this
	program you may initiate the installation procedure by typing:

		make Everything >& make-output &

	You can watch the output with:

		tail -f make-output

	If this is not your first installation attempt, and you simply 
	made some changes in the configuration, restart the process using:

		make All >>& make-output &
	
	This command does not erase object code that has already
	been compiled.

	Both of these commands run the installation procedure
	in the background, and you can track its progress
	by periodically examining the file "make-output" while 
	the installation proceeds.
