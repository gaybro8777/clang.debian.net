 Description: GNU R extended structural equation modelling
  Create structural equation models that can be manipulated
  programmatically. Models may be specified with matrices or paths (LISREL
  or RAM) Example models include confirmatory factor, multiple group,
  mixture distribution, categorical threshold, modern test theory,
  differential Fit functions include full information maximum likelihood,
  maximum likelihood, and weighted least squares. equations, state space,
  and many others. Support and advanced package binaries available at
  <http://openmx.ssri.psu.edu>. The software is described in Neale,
  Hunter, Pritikin, Zahery, Brick, Kirkpatrick, Estabrook, Bates, Maes, &
  Boker (2016) <doi:10.1007/s11336-014-9435-8>.
