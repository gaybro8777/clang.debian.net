 Description: Spherical data types for PostgreSQL
  PgSphere, an extension for PostgreSQL, aims at providing uniform
  access to spherical data. It allows for a fast search and analysis for
  objects with spherical attributes in geographical, astronomical, or
  other applications using PostgreSQL.
  .
  By using an SQL interface, PgSphere's users can conveniently manage
  data of geographical objects around the world and astronomical data
  collections like star and other catalogues.
