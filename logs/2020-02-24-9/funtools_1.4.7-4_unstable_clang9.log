 Description: Minimal buy-in FITS utility package
  Funtools, is a "minimal buy-in" FITS library and utility package developed at
  the High Energy Astrophysics Division of SAO. The Funtools library
  provides simplified access to a wide array of file types: standard
  astronomical FITS images and binary tables, raw arrays and binary event
  lists, and even tables of ASCII column data. A sophisticated region filtering
  library (compatible with ds9) filters images and tables using boolean
  operations between geometric shapes, support world coordinates, etc. Funtools
  also supports advanced capabilities such as optimized data searching using
  index files.
  .
  This package contains the tools.

 Description: Minimal buy-in FITS library
  Funtools, is a "minimal buy-in" FITS library and utility package developed at
  the High Energy Astrophysics Division of SAO. The Funtools library
  provides simplified access to a wide array of file types: standard
  astronomical FITS images and binary tables, raw arrays and binary event
  lists, and even tables of ASCII column data. A sophisticated region filtering
  library (compatible with ds9) filters images and tables using boolean
  operations between geometric shapes, support world coordinates, etc. Funtools
  also supports advanced capabilities such as optimized data searching using
  index files.
  .
  This library contains the shared library.
